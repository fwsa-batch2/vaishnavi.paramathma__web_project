            Being a large visitor
            attraction, there is
            always lots going on at
            paignton zoo!
        </h2>
        <p>
            Here is where we let you know about all of the latest updates prior to your visit, including any exhibit
            closures, weather updates, animals off-show or planned maintenance work.

            We always aim to offer the best possible experience for our guests and thank you for your understanding.

        <h2>
            BOARDWALK CLOSURE
        </h2>
        <p>
            Our boardwalk is being redeveloped, so when you visit the zoo from now on your entry and exit route<br> will
            be slightly different. Instead of going across the boardwalk you will be directed through Brookside
            <br>Aviary and then follow the signposted path around into the zoo. When you exit the zoo follow the<br> big
            cats route back to Brookside Aviary.
            As you are probably aware, there is a nationwide <br>shortage of building materials, and we are working with
            our contractors to start this project as soon<br> as possible.
            We will keep this page updated on<br> how our boardwalk redevelopment is progressing.

        <h2>
            PATH CLOSURE
        </h2>
        <p>
            The path between the mandrills and rhinos will be closed throughout November to allow essential maintenance
            to take place on the rhino wall. We apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause.

        <h2>TICKETING AND ENTRY</h2>
        <p>
            Pre-booking online is not essential, however, to ensure that you are able to visit Paignton Zoo on your
            preferred date and time, we would suggest booking your tickets in advance. Annual Pass holders may check in
            using Gate 5.

            Face coverings and social distancing are no longer compulsory in indoor or outdoor areas. However, please do
            respect guests and team members who still wish to adhere to these measures.

            If you have a complimentary ticket, existing pre-paid ticket, Childminder Pass or Welcome Return ticket,
            please call 01803 697500 to book your time slot as we cannot process these bookings online.

            For more details, please see our Staying Safe at the Zoo guide here.

            Please note: we cannot transfer any ticket or time slot bookings.
        </p>

        <h2>
            WHICH EXHIBITS ARE OPEN/CLOSED AND ANIMALS OFF SHOW
        </h2>
        <p>
            All outdoor exhibits and the majority of our indoor exhibits are open. Our indoor soft play is now open.
            Face coverings are no longer required in indoor spaces.

            The following exhibits are currently closed due to maintenance: Giraffe House (outdoor viewing available),
            Jungle Express Train and Nocturnal House.

            There may be times when some of our animals may not be viewable at the exact time that you visit an exhibit
            as we not do not ‘force’ them to be ‘on-show’. If an animal is not immediately visible, they could be
            resting in their off-show area or somewhere out of view in their naturalistic exhibit, so please make time
            to pop back later in the day – it will be worth the wait!

            For example, our big cats are usually more active and easier to spot in the afternoons. We cannot guarantee
            that you will see every single animal of the day of your visit.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>FOOD & DRINK</h2>
        <p>
            We are serving a full food and drink menu every day at Paignton Zoo.
            The Island Restaurant is open daily from 10am until half an hour before the zoo closes and other catering
            cabins around the site are also open (serving times do vary).
            Vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options are available in all of our food outlets, with plenty of outdoor
            seating and picnic areas for guests to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a query that is not answered here, please email us at paigntonzoo@wildplanettrust.org.uk and we
            will aim to get back to you as quickly as possible.
            And to further keep up-to-date with everything Paignton Zoo related, please make sure you follow our social
            media channels too!
