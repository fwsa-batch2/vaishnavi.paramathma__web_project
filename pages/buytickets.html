            THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU BOOK:
        </h1>

        Due to Covid-19 we are limiting the number of visitors that will be in the zoo each day. This means you'll<br>
        need to <strong>BOOK ONLINE </strong>- even if you have an Annual Pass or pre-paid ticket.<br><br>

        Tickets and timeslots are now available up until Sunday 9th January 2022. Please note all admission<br>
        tickets are non-refundable.<br><br>

        Available dates are in green, you CANNOT book onto greyed out dates as these tickets have not been<br>
        released yet.<br><br>

        Entry is permitted in 1 hour time slots - this refers to your arrival time only, not the length of your
        visit.<br><br>

        Please note: due to the latest government restrictions face masks are now mandatory in all indoor
        spaces.<br><br>

        Whilst we've made every effort to safely reopen all areas of the zoo, some exhibits may remain closed.<br>
        For a full list of what exhibits are available, please visit the Updates page of our website.<br><br>

        Due to the growing number of Avian Flu cases in the UK, from Monday 29th November 2021 we are <br>
        required by law to implement footbaths outside the following bird enclosures: Brookside Aviary &<br>
        Tropical Trails/Arid Lands. All visitors will be required to use these upon entering and exiting these<br>
        areas. We apologise for any inconvenience caused however this is a vital measure we must take to<br>
        protect our bird species.<br><br>

        <strong>UNDER 3's, CARERS AND STUDENTS:</strong><br><br>

        Children under 3 and Carers must book onto a time slot, to book in as a Carer you must select an Under<br>
        3 ticket. Students must bring a valid student card with expiry date on the day of visit.<br><br>

        <strong>OTHER TICKETS:</strong><br><br>

        If you have a Welcome Return, complimentary or pre-paid ticket please call our Reception team on<br>
        01803 697500 to book a time slot.<br><br>

        Don't forget...staying safe is everyone's responsibility; for full details on the measures we've taken to<br>
        ensure you have a safe and happy visit, take a look at our Staying safe at the Zoo webpage.<br><br>
